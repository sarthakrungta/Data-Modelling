# Data-Modelling---Heart-Failure-dataset
A data modelling project based on the UCI heart failure dataset. 

## Description
This project was developed as an assignment for my Practical data science elective @ RMIT University.  
  
In this project, I expplored and modelled UCI'S heart failure dataset:  
This dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features.  

Each of these features was explored in detail, indivudually and as a collective to decide which of these features were most likely to cause 'death by heart failure'  
This data was then used to create a two classification models:
1) k-nearest neighbours
2) decision tree

## Technologies used
This project was made using 'Jupyter Notebook' and various data science based pyhton libraries such as sklearn, numpy, pandas and seaborn
